# FCM Registration

## Overview
If we want to use authentication on other platforms, such as web (not mobile web) or window, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) registration is required.

## Feature Description
When requesting for authentication, push notifications will be sent through the FCM to the GuardianSDK-connected mobile application and will be utilized for further authentication progress.
